# SOP-2085: Specialty Coating Application

## 1. Purpose
Establish standardized procedures for applying specialty roof coatings including elastomeric, reflective, and protective coatings to ensure optimal performance and longevity in Florida's climate conditions.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all field crews, project managers, and quality control personnel involved in specialty coating application for residential and commercial roofing projects.

## 3. Definitions
- **Elastomeric Coating**: Flexible, rubber-like coating that expands and contracts with temperature changes
- **Reflective Coating**: Highly reflective surface coating designed to reduce heat absorption
- **Primer**: Base coat applied to ensure proper adhesion of specialty coatings
- **Mil Thickness**: Measurement of coating thickness (1 mil = 0.001 inch)
- **Cure Time**: Time required for coating to fully dry and achieve specified properties

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Field Supervisor**: Overall project oversight, quality verification, safety compliance
- **Coating Specialist**: Proper application techniques, thickness measurement, surface preparation
- **Safety Officer**: Ventilation setup, PPE compliance, environmental monitoring
- **Quality Inspector**: Application verification, thickness testing, documentation

## 5. Prerequisites
- Valid Florida roofing contractor license
- OSHA 10-hour construction safety certification
- Manufacturer-specific coating application training
- Current weather conditions assessment
- Substrate compatibility verification

## 6. Materials and Equipment
### Materials:
- Manufacturer-approved specialty coating
- Compatible primer system
- Surface preparation materials
- Cleaning solvents and degreasers
- Reinforcement mesh (if required)

### Equipment:
- Airless spray equipment with appropriate tips
- Mil thickness gauges
- Power washers and surface preparation tools
- Environmental monitoring equipment
- Safety and ventilation equipment

## 7. Procedure

### 7.1 Pre-Application Assessment
1. **Weather Conditions Verification**
   - Temperature: 50°F to 90°F
   - Humidity: Below 85%
   - No precipitation forecast for 24-48 hours
   - Wind speed: Below 15 mph
   - Document conditions every 2 hours

2. **Substrate Evaluation**
   - Inspect for structural integrity
   - Identify and address any defects
   - Test substrate compatibility
   - Verify moisture content below 18%
   - Document all findings

### 7.2 Surface Preparation
1. **Cleaning Process**
   - Remove all debris, dirt, and loose materials
   - Power wash with appropriate pressure (1500-3000 PSI)
   - Allow 24-48 hours drying time
   - Remove all mildew, algae, and biological growth
   - Degrease contaminated areas

2. **Repair and Priming**
   - Fill cracks and holes with compatible filler
   - Sand rough surfaces to ensure uniformity
   - Apply primer according to manufacturer specifications
   - Allow primer to cure per manufacturer requirements
   - Inspect primer adhesion and coverage

### 7.3 Coating Application
1. **Equipment Setup**
   - Calibrate spray equipment
   - Test spray pattern and pressure
   - Set up containment and ventilation
   - Verify material temperature and consistency
   - Establish work area boundaries

2. **Application Process**
   - Apply coating in thin, uniform passes
   - Maintain proper wet film thickness
   - Overlap passes by 10-20%
   - Monitor for runs, sags, or thin spots
   - Apply multiple coats as specified

3. **Quality Control During Application**
   - Measure wet film thickness every 100 sq ft
   - Check for uniform coverage and color
   - Document application conditions
   - Address defects immediately
   - Verify proper cure between coats

### 7.4 Florida Climate Considerations
1. **Hurricane Preparation**
   - Use hurricane-rated coating systems
   - Apply additional reinforcement at critical areas
   - Document wind resistance specifications
   - Plan for seasonal application windows

2. **Humidity Management**
   - Monitor relative humidity continuously
   - Use dehumidification equipment when necessary
   - Adjust application schedule for optimal conditions
   - Extend cure times in high humidity

3. **UV Protection**
   - Apply UV-resistant topcoats
   - Schedule work to minimize UV exposure during application
   - Use reflective coatings for energy efficiency
   - Monitor coating degradation over time

### 7.5 Post-Application Inspection
1. **Immediate Inspection**
   - Check for complete coverage
   - Verify proper thickness with dry film gauge
   - Identify and repair any defects
   - Document final thickness measurements
   - Take photographic documentation

2. **Cure Monitoring**
   - Monitor curing progress
   - Protect from precipitation during cure
   - Test adhesion after full cure
   - Verify performance specifications
   - Complete final quality report

## 8. Quality Standards
- Coating thickness: ±10% of specification
- Coverage: 100% with no holidays or thin spots
- Adhesion: Pass cross-hatch adhesion test
- Appearance: Uniform color and texture
- Performance: Meet manufacturer warranty requirements

## 9. Safety Requirements
- Full PPE including respirators for solvent-based coatings
- Adequate ventilation in enclosed areas
- Fall protection systems for elevated work
- Emergency wash stations for chemical exposure
- Environmental monitoring for vapors

## 10. Environmental Considerations
- Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) compliance
- Proper disposal of waste materials
- Containment of overspray and runoff
- Use of low-impact application methods
- Florida environmental regulation compliance

## 11. Documentation
- Pre-application condition reports
- Weather monitoring logs
- Thickness measurement records
- Quality control inspection reports
- Manufacturer warranty documentation

## 12. Training Requirements
- Manufacturer-specific application training
- Safety training for chemical handling
- Equipment operation certification
- Florida building code updates
- Ongoing professional development
