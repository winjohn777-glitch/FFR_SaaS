- [ ] Check weather conditions and safety requirements
- [ ] Verify proper safety equipment and assessment tools
- [ ] Review insurance requirements and liability considerations
- [ ] Prepare standardized forms and documentation systems
- [ ] Coordinate with customer regarding access and timing

## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Preliminary Assessment and Site Safety
1. **Property Overview and Documentation**:
   - Photograph property exterior and overall roof conditions
   - Document property address, construction details, and access routes
   - Identify architectural style, roof complexity, and special features
   - Note environmental factors (trees, nearby buildings, exposure)
   - Record weather conditions and assessment date/time

2. **Safety Assessment and Access Planning**:
   - Evaluate roof access safety and fall protection requirements
   - Assess roof structural integrity and load-bearing capacity
   - Identify potential hazards (electrical, structural, environmental)
   - Plan safe walking routes and area restrictions
   - Establish emergency procedures and communication protocols

3. **Initial Visual Survey from Ground Level**:
   - Use binoculars to assess general roof conditions
   - Identify obvious damage, wear patterns, or deficiencies
   - Document gutter and drainage system conditions
   - Note any immediate safety concerns or emergency issues
   - Determine need for specialized equipment or expertise

### Phase 2: Detailed Roof Surface Assessment
1. **Roofing Material Evaluation**:
   - **Asphalt Shingles**: Check for granule loss, cracking, curling, missing shingles
   - **Tile Roofing**: Assess for cracked, loose, or displaced tiles
   - **Metal Roofing**: Examine for corrosion, fastener issues, panel damage
   - **Membrane Systems**: Evaluate for punctures, seam failures, weathering
   - **Specialty Materials**: Apply appropriate evaluation criteria

2. **Structural and Substrate Assessment**:
   - Check for sagging, deflection, or structural irregularities
   - Assess decking conditions through visible areas
   - Identify areas requiring further structural evaluation
   - Document any signs of moisture intrusion or damage
   - Evaluate ventilation adequacy and functionality

3. **Flashing and Penetration Evaluation**:
   - Inspect all roof penetrations (vents, chimneys, skylights)
   - Assess flashing conditions and weatherproofing integrity
   - Check valley and edge flashing installation and condition
   - Evaluate caulking and sealant conditions
   - Document any water entry points or vulnerability areas

### Phase 3: Drainage and Gutter System Assessment
1. **Drainage System Functionality**:
   - Assess roof slope and water flow patterns
   - Identify ponding areas or drainage deficiencies
   - Check downspout capacity and functionality
   - Evaluate gutter condition and attachment integrity
   - Document any modifications needed for proper drainage

2. **Gutter and Downspout Inspection**:
   - Check for proper slope and water flow
   - Assess gutter attachment and structural integrity
   - Inspect for clogs, damage, or deterioration
   - Evaluate downspout discharge and drainage adequacy
   - Document any safety or functionality issues

### Phase 4: Interior Assessment (When Accessible)
1. **Attic Space Evaluation**:
   - Assess insulation levels and condition
   - Check for proper ventilation and air circulation
   - Identify signs of moisture intrusion or condensation
   - Document structural conditions and modifications
   - Evaluate electrical and HVAC system interactions

2. **Interior Ceiling Inspection**:
   - Look for water stains or discoloration
   - Check for ceiling sag or structural issues
   - Document any visible damage or moisture problems
   - Assess previous repairs and their effectiveness
   - Coordinate with customer regarding access limitations

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- Assessment completeness: 100% coverage of all roof areas and components
- Documentation accuracy: Complete photographic and written records
- Safety compliance: Zero incidents during assessment activities
- Customer communication: Clear explanation of findings and recommendations
- Recommendation validity: 95% accuracy of cost estimates based on assessments

## 9. Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues:
- **Inaccessible areas**: Use alternative assessment methods or specialized equipment
- **Unclear damage cause**: Research weather history and consult specialists
- **Customer access limitations**: Coordinate scheduling and access requirements
- **Complex technical issues**: Engage structural engineers or specialists
- **Insurance documentation needs**: Provide detailed reports and evidence

### Resolution Procedures:
1. Document limitations and constraints affecting assessment
2. Implement alternative assessment methods when possible
3. Engage appropriate specialists for technical evaluation
4. Communicate findings and limitations clearly to customers
5. Update assessment procedures based on lessons learned
