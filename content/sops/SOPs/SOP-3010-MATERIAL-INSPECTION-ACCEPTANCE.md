   - Check for proper labeling and identification markings
   - Verify lot numbers and manufacturing date codes
   - Assess overall condition and handling during transportation
   - Document any obvious defects or concerns immediately

3. **Quantity Verification**:
   - Count pieces, bundles, or units against delivery documentation
   - Verify weights and measurements for bulk materials
   - Document any quantity discrepancies or shortages
   - Check for complete delivery of accessory items and components
   - Coordinate with delivery personnel on any issues identified

### Phase 2: Detailed Material Inspection
1. **Dimensional and Physical Inspection**:
   - **Shingles and Tiles**: Check dimensions, thickness, and weight specifications
   - **Metal Materials**: Verify gauge, coating thickness, and profile accuracy
   - **Membrane Systems**: Inspect thickness, width, and seam preparation
   - **Fasteners**: Check length, diameter, coating, and thread specifications
   - **Accessories**: Verify dimensions and compatibility with primary materials

2. **Quality Standards Verification**:
   - Check surface finish quality and consistency
   - Inspect for manufacturing defects or irregularities
   - Verify color matching and consistency within lots
   - Assess flexibility, strength, and durability characteristics
   - Confirm compliance with specified performance standards

3. **Compliance and Certification Review**:
   - Verify Florida Building Code approval numbers and markings
   - Check manufacturer certifications and test reports
   - Confirm wind resistance ratings and hurricane performance data
   - Review warranty coverage and registration requirements
   - Validate energy code compliance for applicable materials

### Phase 3: Testing and Performance Verification
1. **Sample Testing Procedures**:
   - Collect representative samples according to testing protocols
   - Conduct thickness measurements and dimensional verification
   - Perform flexibility and durability tests as required
   - Test adhesion strength for membrane and sealant materials
   - Document all testing results and compliance verification

2. **Environmental Compliance Testing**:
   - Verify moisture content levels for wood and composite materials
   - Check temperature stability and thermal performance characteristics
   - Test UV resistance and weathering performance specifications
   - Confirm chemical resistance and compatibility requirements
   - Validate fire resistance ratings and safety certifications

3. **Batch and Lot Consistency Verification**:
   - Compare materials from different production batches
   - Verify consistency in color, texture, and performance characteristics
   - Check for variations that could affect installation or appearance
   - Document any lot-to-lot variations or concerns
   - Coordinate with suppliers on consistency requirements

### Phase 4: Acceptance Decision and Documentation
1. **Acceptance Criteria Evaluation**:
   - Compare all inspection results against established acceptance standards
   - Evaluate any non-conformances against project requirements
   - Determine impact of any deficiencies on project quality or timeline
   - Coordinate with project managers on acceptance decisions
   - Document rationale for acceptance or rejection decisions

2. **Material Disposition and Storage**:
   - **Accepted Materials**: Move to appropriate storage areas with proper identification
   - **Conditional Acceptance**: Segregate and mark for limited use or monitoring
   - **Rejected Materials**: Quarantine and coordinate return with suppliers
   - **Damaged Materials**: Document damage and coordinate insurance claims
   - **Special Storage**: Follow manufacturer requirements for sensitive materials

3. **Documentation and Record Keeping**:
   - Complete inspection reports with detailed findings and photographs
   - Update inventory systems with accepted material quantities and locations
   - Maintain material certification files and compliance documentation
   - Generate non-conformance reports for rejected or deficient materials
   - Communicate inspection results to project teams and stakeholders

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- Inspection completeness: 100% of incoming materials inspected before acceptance
