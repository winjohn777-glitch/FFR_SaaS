## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Electrical Hazard Assessment
1. **Site Survey and Documentation**:
   - Identify overhead power lines and their voltage levels
   - Locate building electrical service entrances and panels
   - Map underground electrical utilities using utility locates
   - Document electrical equipment on or near the roof
   - Assess proximity of work areas to electrical hazards

2. **Voltage Classification and Clearance Requirements**:
   - **50V or less**: No special clearance required
   - **Over 50V to 300V**: Minimum 10 feet clearance
   - **Over 300V to 50kV**: Minimum 10 feet clearance
   - **Over 50kV**: Contact utility company for specific requirements
   - **Unknown voltage**: Treat as high voltage (minimum 10 feet)

3. **Documentation and Communication**:
   - Complete electrical hazard assessment form
   - Photograph electrical installations and clearance measurements
   - Contact utility companies for de-energization if required
   - Notify building owners of electrical safety requirements
   - Update project safety plan with electrical hazard controls

### Phase 2: Control Measure Implementation
1. **Engineering Controls**:
   - Request utility company de-energization when feasible
   - Install physical barriers between work areas and electrical hazards
   - Use non-conductive materials and tools near electrical equipment
   - Implement safe work zones with clear boundary markings
   - Coordinate with electrical contractors for system modifications

2. **Administrative Controls**:
   - Establish restricted access zones around electrical hazards
   - Develop specific work procedures for electrical hazard areas
   - Train workers on electrical hazard recognition and response
   - Implement buddy system for work near electrical equipment
   - Schedule work to avoid peak electrical usage periods

3. **Personal Protective Equipment**:
   - Electrical hazard-rated hard hats and safety boots
   - Insulated gloves appropriate for voltage exposure level
   - Non-conductive clothing and equipment
   - Arc flash protection when required by electrical contractor
   - Emergency rescue equipment for electrical incident response

### Phase 3: Safe Work Practices
1. **Working Near Overhead Power Lines**:
   - Maintain minimum 10-foot clearance from energized conductors
   - Use only non-conductive ladders and equipment
   - Never use metal measuring tapes or poles near power lines
   - Position vehicles and equipment outside minimum clearance zones
   - Assign spotter to monitor clearance distances continuously

2. **Rooftop Electrical Equipment Safety**:
   - Assume all electrical equipment is energized
   - Maintain required clearances from electrical panels and conduits
   - Never use electrical equipment as anchor points or supports
   - Coordinate with building electrical contractor before roof penetrations
   - Protect electrical equipment from construction debris and damage

3. **Weather-Related Electrical Safety**:
   - Cease all work during electrical storms
   - Monitor weather radar for approaching storm systems
   - Secure all metal tools and equipment before storms
   - Never work on wet roofs near electrical equipment
   - Implement lightning protection procedures for crew safety

### Phase 4: Emergency Response Procedures
1. **Electrical Shock Response**:
   - Do not touch victim until power source is confirmed de-energized
   - Call 911 immediately for medical emergency response
   - Shut off power at source if safely accessible
   - Administer CPR if trained and victim is not breathing
   - Document incident details for investigation and reporting

2. **Electrical Fire Response**:
   - Never use water on electrical fires
   - Use Class C fire extinguishers for electrical equipment fires
   - Evacuate area and call fire department immediately
   - Shut off electrical power if safely accessible
   - Provide access for emergency responders
