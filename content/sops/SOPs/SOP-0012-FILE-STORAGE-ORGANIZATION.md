## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Organization
1. **Primary Directory Hierarchy**:
   ```
   /Company_Root/
   ├── Administration/
   │   ├── HR_Personnel/
   │   ├── Policies_Procedures/
   │   └── Corporate_Documents/
   ├── Projects/
   │   ├── Active_Projects/
   │   ├── Completed_Projects/
   │   └── Project_Templates/
   ├── Customers/
   │   ├── Customer_Records/
   │   ├── Communications/
   │   └── Service_History/
   ├── Financial/
   │   ├── Accounting_Records/
   │   ├── Tax_Documents/
   │   └── Banking_Information/
   ├── Safety_Compliance/
   │   ├── OSHA_Documentation/
   │   ├── Training_Records/
   │   └── Incident_Reports/
   └── Technical_Resources/
       ├── Specifications/
       ├── Installation_Guides/
       └── Manufacturer_Data/
   ```

2. **Naming Convention Standards**:
   - **Date Format**: YYYY-MM-DD for chronological sorting
   - **Project Files**: PROJ-####-Description-YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Customer Files**: CUST-####-LastName-FirstName-YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Version Control**: Document-Name-v##-YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Document Types**: Use standard abbreviations (EST=Estimate, INV=Invoice, RPT=Report)

### Phase 2: File Classification and Storage
1. **Document Classification System**:
   - **Class A - Critical**: Contracts, permits, insurance documents
   - **Class B - Important**: Correspondence, estimates, reports
   - **Class C - Reference**: Specifications, manuals, templates
   - **Class D - Archive**: Completed projects, historical records

2. **Storage Location Assignment**:
   - **Active Documents**: Primary NAS with daily backup
   - **Reference Materials**: Secondary storage with weekly backup
   - **Archive Documents**: Long-term storage with monthly verification
   - **Sensitive Data**: Encrypted storage with restricted access

3. **Retention Schedule Implementation**:
   - **Financial Records**: 7 years minimum (Florida requirement)
   - **Safety Documentation**: Permanent retention
   - **Customer Communications**: 5 years after project completion
   - **Project Files**: 10 years after completion
   - **Employee Records**: Follow Florida employment law requirements

### Phase 3: Access Control and Security
1. **User Permission Levels**:
   - **Administrator**: Full access to all directories and functions
   - **Manager**: Departmental access with modification rights
   - **Staff**: Limited access based on job function and need
   - **Field**: Mobile access to project-specific documents only
   - **Guest**: Read-only access to specified public documents

2. **Security Implementation**:
   - Multi-factor authentication for all users
   - Regular password updates (minimum 90 days)
   - Audit logs for all file access and modifications
   - Automatic session timeouts for inactive users
   - VPN requirements for remote access

### Phase 4: Search and Retrieval Procedures
1. **Search Strategy Development**:
   - **Metadata Search**: Use document properties and tags
   - **Full-Text Search**: Search within document content
   - **Filtered Search**: Combine multiple criteria for precision
   - **Advanced Search**: Use boolean operators and wildcards

2. **Retrieval Protocols**:
   - Document unique identifiers and version tracking
   - Check-out/check-in procedures for collaborative editing
   - Download logs and access tracking
   - Temporary file cleanup and management

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- File organization compliance: 100% adherence to naming conventions
- Backup success rate: 99.9% reliability for all critical documents
