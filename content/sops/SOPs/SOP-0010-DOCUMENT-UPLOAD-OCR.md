# SOP-0010: Document Upload and OCR Processing Procedures

## 1. Purpose
Establish standardized procedures for document upload, optical character recognition (OCR) processing, and digital file management to ensure accurate data extraction and searchable document storage.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all administrative staff, project managers, and field personnel responsible for document digitization, processing, and management within the company's digital asset management system.

## 3. Responsibilities
- **Office Manager**: System maintenance and user access management
- **Administrative Staff**: Daily document processing and quality control
- **Project Managers**: Project-specific document validation and approval
- **IT Administrator**: Technical troubleshooting and system updates
- **Field Personnel**: Mobile document capture and preliminary processing

## 4. Required Materials and Equipment
### Hardware:
- High-resolution scanner (minimum 300 DPI capability)
- Mobile devices with camera functionality (minimum 8MP)
- Backup storage devices and cloud access
- Network-attached storage (NAS) for local backup

### Software:
- OCR processing software with confidence scoring
- Document management system with version control
- CRM integration modules
- Quality assurance validation tools
- Mobile document capture applications

## 5. Safety Considerations
- Ensure proper ergonomic setup for scanning workstations
- Maintain clean work environment to prevent document damage
- Follow electrical safety protocols for equipment operation
- Secure handling of confidential customer documents
- Data privacy compliance for sensitive information processing

## 6. Pre-Operation Checklist
- [ ] Verify scanner calibration and image quality settings
- [ ] Confirm OCR software is updated and functioning
- [ ] Check network connectivity and cloud storage access
- [ ] Validate document management system login credentials
- [ ] Ensure adequate storage space for processing queue
- [ ] Verify backup systems are operational
- [ ] Test quality assurance validation tools

## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Document Preparation
1. **Sort documents by type and priority**
   - Contracts and legal documents (Priority 1)
   - Insurance claims and correspondence (Priority 2)
   - Permits and inspection reports (Priority 3)
   - Material invoices and receipts (Priority 4)
   - General correspondence (Priority 5)

2. **Remove staples, clips, and binding materials**
3. **Check for document damage or illegible sections**
4. **Arrange documents in sequential order**
5. **Create batch processing lists with document counts**

### Phase 2: Digital Capture
1. **Configure scanner settings**:
   - Resolution: 300 DPI minimum for text, 600 DPI for detailed drawings
   - Color mode: Color for original documents, grayscale for copies
   - File format: PDF for multi-page, TIFF for archival quality

2. **Scan documents in batches**:
   - Maximum 25 pages per batch for optimal processing
   - Verify image quality before proceeding
   - Re-scan any pages with poor quality or distortion

3. **Mobile capture procedures**:
   - Use adequate lighting conditions
   - Maintain steady hand position
   - Capture full document within frame boundaries
   - Verify image clarity before proceeding

### Phase 3: OCR Processing
1. **Upload documents to OCR processing queue**
2. **Configure OCR settings based on document type**:
   - Standard text documents: High accuracy mode
   - Forms and tables: Structure recognition enabled
   - Handwritten notes: Manual review required
   - Technical drawings: OCR bypass, metadata only

3. **Monitor processing progress and error logs**
4. **Review OCR confidence scores** (minimum 85% accuracy required)
5. **Flag documents requiring manual review**

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
1. **Verify text extraction accuracy**
2. **Check for missing or corrupted pages**
3. **Validate metadata assignment**
4. **Confirm file naming conventions**
5. **Review auto-categorization suggestions**
6. **Approve or correct OCR results**

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- OCR accuracy rate: Minimum 85% confidence score
- Processing time: Maximum 24 hours for standard documents
- Image quality: Minimum 300 DPI resolution
- File size optimization: Balance quality with storage efficiency
- Error rate: Less than 2% requiring manual correction
- Backup completion: 100% of processed documents

## 9. Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues:
- **Poor OCR accuracy**: Check scan quality, adjust lighting, re-process
- **System timeout errors**: Reduce batch size, check network connection
- **File corruption**: Verify original document integrity, re-scan if necessary
- **Storage capacity issues**: Archive older files, expand storage allocation
- **Integration failures**: Restart services, verify API connections

### Error Resolution:
1. Document error occurrence with timestamp
2. Identify root cause through system logs
3. Implement corrective action
4. Verify resolution through test processing
5. Update procedures if systematic issue identified

## 10. Documentation Requirements
- Daily processing logs with batch counts and error rates
- Quality assurance reports with accuracy metrics
- System maintenance records and update histories
- User access logs and permission changes
- Monthly performance reports with improvement recommendations

## 11. Integration Points
### CRM Integration:
- Automatic customer record linking
- Document notification alerts
- Project timeline updates
- Contact history synchronization

### LMS Integration:
- Training material updates
- Procedure documentation access
- User competency tracking
- Compliance verification records

## 12. Performance Metrics
- **Processing Volume**: Documents processed per day/week/month
- **Quality Metrics**: OCR accuracy rates and error frequencies
- **Efficiency Measures**: Processing time per document type
- **System Reliability**: Uptime percentage and error recovery times
- **User Satisfaction**: Ease of use and system responsiveness ratings

## 13. Training Requirements
