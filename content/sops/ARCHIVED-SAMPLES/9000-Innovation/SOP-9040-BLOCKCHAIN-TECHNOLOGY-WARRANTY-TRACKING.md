## Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure establishes comprehensive protocols for implementing and managing blockchain technology for warranty tracking, ensuring immutable record-keeping, transparent warranty management, and enhanced customer trust through distributed ledger technology.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all warranty documentation, tracking systems, claims processing, and customer warranty management processes that utilize blockchain technology across Florida First Roofing LLC operations.

## Definitions

- **Blockchain**: Distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records linked and secured using cryptography
