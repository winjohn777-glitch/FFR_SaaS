## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Thermal Resistance (R-Value)**: A measure of a material's ability to resist heat transfer, expressed in hr·ft²·°F/Btu.

**Thermal Bridging**: A path of high thermal conductivity through an insulation layer that reduces overall thermal performance.

**Continuous Insulation**: Insulation that is continuous across all structural members without thermal bridges.

**Air Barrier**: A system of materials designed to resist airflow through the building envelope.

**Vapor Retarder**: A material or system that adequately retards the transmission of water vapor.

**Radiant Barrier**: A material with low emissivity that reduces radiant heat transfer.

**Thermal Envelope**: The building elements that separate conditioned space from unconditioned space.
