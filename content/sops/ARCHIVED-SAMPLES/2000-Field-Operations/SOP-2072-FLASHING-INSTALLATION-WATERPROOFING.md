## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Flashing**: A thin impervious material placed in construction to prevent water penetration or direct the flow of water.

**Step Flashing**: Individual pieces of flashing material installed in a stepped pattern along roof-to-wall intersections.

**Counterflashing**: The upper piece of flashing that overlaps and covers the top edge of base flashing.

**Through-Wall Flashing**: Flashing that extends completely through a wall to direct water to the exterior.
