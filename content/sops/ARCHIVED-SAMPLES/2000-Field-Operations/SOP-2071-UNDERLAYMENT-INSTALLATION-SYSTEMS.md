- Synthetic underlayment installation
- Asphalt-saturated felt installation
- Self-adhering membrane installation
- Ice and water shield installation
- Vapor barrier installation
- Ridge vent preparation
- Valley underlayment systems

## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Underlayment**: A water-resistant or waterproof barrier material installed on the roof deck beneath the primary roofing material.

**Self-Adhering Membrane**: A waterproof membrane with adhesive backing that bonds directly to the roof deck.

**Ice and Water Shield**: A self-adhering waterproof membrane designed to prevent water infiltration from ice dams and wind-driven rain.

**Vapor Barrier**: A material that reduces the rate of water vapor transmission through a roof assembly.

**Overlap**: The amount one course of underlayment extends over the preceding course.
