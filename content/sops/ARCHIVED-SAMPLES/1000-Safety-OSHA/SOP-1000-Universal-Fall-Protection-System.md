**Guardrail System:** A barrier erected to prevent employees from falling to lower levels, consisting of top rail, midrail, and posts, meeting specific height and strength requirements.

**Safety Net System:** A horizontal or inclined catching system positioned to arrest falling workers, meeting specific impact and installation requirements.

**Controlled Access Zone:** An area designated on a low-slope roof where work may take place without conventional fall protection systems, with specific boundary and supervision requirements.

**Warning Line System:** A barrier erected on a roof to warn employees that they are approaching an unprotected roof side or edge, used in conjunction with other fall protection measures.

**Competent Person:** An individual capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards and authorized to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them.

**Qualified Person:** An individual with recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or extensive knowledge, training, and experience in fall protection systems.
