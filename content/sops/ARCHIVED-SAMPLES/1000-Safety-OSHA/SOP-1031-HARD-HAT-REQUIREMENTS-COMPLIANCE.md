   - **Type II**: Protection from vertical and lateral impact and penetration
   - **Work Environment**: Assess specific job site hazards and requirements
   - **Duration of Use**: Consider comfort features for extended wear
   - **Environmental Conditions**: Weather resistance and temperature considerations

2. **Hard Hat Class Selection for Electrical Hazards**:
   - **Class G (General)**: Protection up to 2,200 volts AC
   - **Class E (Electrical)**: Protection up to 20,000 volts AC
   - **Class C (Conductive)**: No electrical protection, metal components allowed
   - **Job Site Assessment**: Evaluate electrical hazard exposure potential
   - **Documentation**: Verify electrical class requirements for specific work

3. **Individual Sizing and Fit Requirements**:
   - Measure head circumference for proper size selection
   - Adjust suspension system for secure, comfortable fit
   - Verify clearance between shell and head (1-1.25 inches)
   - Check for pressure points and adjust headband accordingly
   - Test stability during normal work movements

### Phase 2: Hard Hat Inspection and Maintenance
1. **Daily Pre-Use Inspection Procedures**:
   - **Shell Inspection**: Check for cracks, dents, or stress marks
   - **Suspension System**: Inspect headband, straps, and adjustment mechanisms
   - **Chin Strap**: Verify condition and proper attachment if used
   - **Cleanliness**: Check for debris, contamination, or vision obstruction
   - **Label Verification**: Confirm ANSI certification and date markings

2. **Weekly Detailed Inspection Requirements**:
   - Perform comprehensive visual inspection of all components
   - Check for UV degradation and color fading indicating wear
   - Test suspension system adjustment and locking mechanisms
   - Inspect accessories and attachment points for damage
   - Document inspection results and maintenance needs

3. **Cleaning and Maintenance Procedures**:
   - **Shell Cleaning**: Use mild soap and water, avoid harsh chemicals
   - **Suspension Cleaning**: Clean headband and straps regularly
   - **Disinfection**: Use appropriate disinfectants for shared hard hats
   - **Drying**: Allow complete air drying before storage
   - **Storage**: Store in cool, dry location away from direct sunlight

### Phase 3: Proper Use and Compliance
1. **Correct Wearing and Positioning**:
   - Position hard hat squarely on head with bill forward
   - Adjust suspension system for snug but comfortable fit
   - Maintain proper clearance between shell and head
   - Secure chin strap when required for high-wind or elevated work
   - Ensure unobstructed vision and hearing

2. **Prohibited Modifications and Uses**:
   - **No Drilling**: Never drill holes in hard hat shell
   - **No Painting**: Avoid painting that may hide defects or damage
   - **No Stickers**: Limit decals that may affect inspection or integrity
   - **No Reverse Wear**: Never wear hard hat backwards unless designed for it
   - **No Heat Exposure**: Avoid storage in vehicles or near heat sources

3. **Work Environment Considerations**:
   - Verify electrical class requirements before entering electrical areas
   - Consider high-visibility colors for traffic and crane operations
   - Use chin straps for elevated work or high-wind conditions
   - Coordinate with other PPE for integrated protection
   - Monitor environmental conditions affecting hard hat performance

### Phase 4: Replacement and Record Keeping
1. **Hard Hat Replacement Criteria**:
