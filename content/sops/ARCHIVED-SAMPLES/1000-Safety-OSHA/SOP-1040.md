2. **Safety Data Sheet Collection and Management**:
   - Obtain current safety data sheets for all chemicals from manufacturers
   - Establish electronic SDS library with searchable database
   - Ensure SDSs are available in appropriate languages for workforce
   - Implement version control to maintain current SDS information
   - Provide multiple access points for SDS information including mobile access

3. **Hazard Assessment and Risk Evaluation**:
   - **Health Hazards**: Evaluate acute and chronic health effects of chemical exposure
   - **Physical Hazards**: Assess fire, explosion, and reactivity risks
   - **Environmental Hazards**: Consider environmental release and contamination potential
   - **Exposure Routes**: Identify inhalation, skin contact, and ingestion pathways
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Develop controls to minimize exposure and hazard risks

### Phase 2: Labeling and Communication Systems
1. **Container Labeling Requirements**:
   - **Primary Containers**: Ensure manufacturer labels remain intact and legible
   - **Secondary Containers**: Apply workplace labels with product identifier and hazard warnings
   - **Storage Areas**: Post area signage indicating chemical hazards and precautions
   - **Pipe and System Labeling**: Label chemical feed lines and storage systems
   - **Multi-Language Labels**: Provide labels in languages understood by workers

2. **Hazard Communication Elements**:
   - **Signal Words**: Use appropriate signal words (Danger/Warning) based on hazard severity
   - **Pictograms**: Display standardized GHS pictograms for hazard identification
   - **Hazard Statements**: Include specific hazard statements describing the nature of risks
   - **Precautionary Statements**: Provide prevention, response, storage, and disposal instructions
   - **Product Identifiers**: Ensure consistent chemical identification across all communications

### Phase 3: Employee Training and Education
1. **Initial Training Program**:
   - **General Hazcom Training**: Overview of hazard communication program and employee rights

   - **SDS Interpretation**: Training on reading and understanding safety data sheets
   - **Label Understanding**: Education on GHS labeling elements and hazard communication
   - **Emergency Procedures**: Response procedures for chemical spills and exposures

2. **Ongoing Training and Updates**:
   - **Annual Refresher Training**: Yearly review of hazard communication requirements
   - **New Chemical Training**: Training when new chemicals are introduced to workplace
   - **Incident-Based Training**: Additional training following chemical incidents or near misses
   - **Supervisor Training**: Enhanced training for supervisors on program implementation
   - **Multi-Language Training**: Training provided in languages understood by all workers

### Phase 4: Implementation and Monitoring
