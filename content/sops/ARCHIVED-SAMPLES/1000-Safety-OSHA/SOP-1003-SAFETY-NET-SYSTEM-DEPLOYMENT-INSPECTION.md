   - Test support structure strength and stability

2. **Net Deployment and Installation**:
   - **Border Rope Installation**: Secure border rope to support structure
   - **Net Attachment**: Connect net to border rope with proper spacing
   - **Tension Adjustment**: Apply appropriate tension without over-stressing
   - **Clearance Verification**: Ensure minimum clearance below net
   - **Access Planning**: Install access points and removal panels

3. **System Integration and Coordination**:
   - Coordinate net installation with guardrail and other fall protection
   - Plan for equipment and material passage through net systems
   - Install warning lines and controlled access zones as required
   - Coordinate with safety monitoring systems and personnel
   - Establish net system boundaries and work area definition

### Phase 3: Inspection and Testing Procedures

   - **Competent Person Inspection**: Qualified person inspection and approval
   - **Strength Verification**: Visual inspection of all connections and hardware
   - **Clearance Measurement**: Verify minimum clearance requirements
   - **Documentation**: Complete inspection forms and certification
   - **Drop Test**: Conduct drop test with 400 lb sand bag where required

2. **Daily Inspection Requirements**:
   - Visual inspection of net condition and connections
   - Check for damage, wear, or deterioration
   - Verify clearance maintenance and obstruction removal
   - Inspect support structure stability and attachment integrity
   - Document inspection results and any deficiencies found

3. **Periodic and Comprehensive Inspections**:
   - Weekly detailed inspection by competent person
   - Monthly comprehensive inspection and documentation
   - Inspection after any impact or potential damage event
   - Annual certification and strength testing verification
