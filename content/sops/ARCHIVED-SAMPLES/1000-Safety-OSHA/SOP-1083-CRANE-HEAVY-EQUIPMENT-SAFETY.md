## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Crane**: Power-operated equipment used to hoist and position loads using a hoist rope or chain.

**Qualified Rigger**: A person who has successfully demonstrated their ability to direct the movement of material/personnel and install rigging equipment.

**Certified Crane Operator**: An operator who has been evaluated and has demonstrated the skills and knowledge required for safe operation.

**Critical Lift**: A lift that exceeds 75% of crane capacity, involves personnel, or presents unusual hazards.

**Load Block**: The assembly of hook or shackle, swivel, bearing, sheaves, pins, and frame suspended by the hoisting rope.
