- **Site Supervisor**: Ensure proper ladder selection and daily inspections
- **Equipment Manager**: Maintain ladder inventory and inspection schedules
- **All Workers**: Follow proper use procedures and report defects immediately
- **Safety Inspector**: Conduct formal ladder safety audits and compliance reviews

## 4. Required Materials and Equipment
### Ladder Types and Specifications:
- Extension ladders (Class I - 250 lb capacity minimum)
- Step ladders (Type IA - 300 lb capacity for heavy duty)
- Platform ladders for extended work periods
- Specialty ladders for specific roofing applications
- Ladder accessories (stabilizers, standoffs, hooks)

### Inspection Tools:
- Measuring devices for proper angle verification
- Inspection checklists and documentation forms
- Cleaning supplies and maintenance materials
- Identification tags and tracking systems
- Safety equipment for ladder users

## 5. Safety Considerations
- Maintain 4:1 ratio for ladder angle (75 degrees from horizontal)
- Ensure 3-foot extension above roof edge for access
- Never exceed manufacturer's weight capacity rating
- Prohibit ladder use during adverse weather conditions
- Require three-point contact at all times during climbing

## 6. Pre-Operation Checklist
- [ ] Verify ladder type is appropriate for intended task
- [ ] Complete visual inspection of all ladder components
- [ ] Check ground conditions and surface stability
- [ ] Confirm proper ladder angle and positioning
- [ ] Verify adequate clearance from electrical hazards
- [ ] Ensure proper personal protective equipment is worn
- [ ] Review weather conditions and wind restrictions

## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Ladder Selection Criteria
1. **Task Analysis**:
   - Determine required working height and reach
   - Assess duration and frequency of use
   - Evaluate weight of worker plus materials and tools
   - Consider environmental conditions and constraints
   - Identify any special requirements or restrictions

2. **Ladder Type Selection**:
   - **Extension Ladders**: For accessing roofs and elevated work areas
   - **Step Ladders**: For stable platform work below roof level
   - **Platform Ladders**: For extended duration tasks requiring tools
   - **Specialty Ladders**: For unique situations or access requirements

3. **Capacity Verification**:
   - Class I (250 lb): Light duty industrial use
   - Class IA (300 lb): Extra heavy duty industrial use
   - Class II (225 lb): Medium duty commercial use
   - Account for worker weight plus tools and materials

### Phase 2: Pre-Use Inspection Procedures
1. **Visual Inspection Components**:
   - **Rails**: Check for cracks, splits, or damage
   - **Rungs/Steps**: Verify secure attachment and condition
   - **Hardware**: Inspect bolts, rivets, and connecting devices
   - **Moving Parts**: Test locks, hinges, and extension mechanisms
   - **Safety Devices**: Verify operation of spreaders and locks

2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Operate all moving parts through full range of motion
   - Test locking mechanisms for proper engagement
   - Verify ladder stability under load conditions
   - Check for excessive wear or deformation
   - Confirm proper labeling and capacity ratings

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Record inspection date and inspector identification
   - Document any defects or maintenance needs
   - Apply inspection tags or labels as required
   - Update maintenance tracking systems
   - Remove defective ladders from service immediately

### Phase 3: Proper Setup and Positioning
1. **Ground Preparation**:
   - Ensure firm, level, and stable surface
   - Remove debris, ice, or slippery materials
   - Use ladder levelers or pads on uneven surfaces
   - Verify adequate load-bearing capacity of ground
   - Position away from traffic areas and hazards

2. **Angle and Distance Calculation**:
   - Use 4:1 rule: For every 4 feet of height, position base 1 foot from wall
   - Measure from wall to ladder base, not roof edge
   - Verify ladder angle using angle indicator or geometric calculation
   - Ensure top of ladder extends 3 feet above roof edge
   - Secure ladder at top and bottom when required

3. **Electrical Safety Considerations**:
   - Maintain minimum 10-foot clearance from power lines
   - Use non-conductive fiberglass ladders near electrical hazards
   - Inspect for overhead wires before positioning
   - Coordinate with utility companies when necessary
   - Train workers on electrical hazard recognition

### Phase 4: Safe Use Techniques
1. **Climbing Procedures**:
   - Maintain three-point contact (two hands, one foot or two feet, one hand)
   - Face ladder while climbing up or down
   - Keep body centered between side rails
   - Avoid overreaching beyond belt buckle line
   - Carry tools in tool belt or haul up separately

2. **Working from Ladders**:
   - Position work within easy reach to avoid overreaching
   - Move ladder rather than leaning to reach work areas
   - Avoid sudden movements or excessive force applications
   - Use ladder accessories for stability and safety
   - Never use top two rungs of step ladders as steps

3. **Multiple Worker Considerations**:
   - Only one person on ladder at a time unless specifically designed for multiple users
   - Coordinate movement and activities to prevent conflicts
   - Establish communication protocols for team ladder use
   - Assign spotter when conditions warrant additional safety measures

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- Inspection completion rate: 100% before each use
- Setup accuracy: 75-degree angle (±5 degrees) for extension ladders
- Defect identification rate: 100% of safety-critical issues documented
- Accident rate: Zero ladder-related incidents per year
- Compliance rate: 100% adherence to OSHA standards

## 9. Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues:
- **Ladder slipping**: Check surface conditions and ladder feet condition
- **Insufficient reach**: Verify proper extension and positioning
- **Instability**: Check setup angle and ground conditions
- **Hardware problems**: Inspect and maintain moving parts regularly
- **Weight capacity concerns**: Verify load calculations and ladder rating

### Resolution Procedures:
1. Stop work immediately if safety is compromised
2. Identify root cause of problem through systematic inspection
3. Implement corrective measures using approved materials and methods
4. Re-inspect ladder before returning to service
5. Document problem and resolution for trend analysis
