## BLOCK 3: DEFINITIONS - Key Terms and Concepts

**Heat Index:** A measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature, calculated using National Weather Service formulas and charts.

**Heat Exhaustion:** A heat-related illness characterized by heavy sweating, weakness, nausea, headache, and elevated body temperature, requiring immediate cooling and medical attention.

**Heat Stroke:** A life-threatening condition where the body's temperature regulation fails, resulting in body temperatures above 104°F, altered mental state, and potential organ failure.

**Acclimatization:** The physiological adaptation process that allows workers to gradually adjust to working in hot environments over a 7-14 day period with progressive heat exposure.

**Cooling Recovery Period:** Mandatory rest periods in air-conditioned or shaded areas with cooling measures to allow body temperature reduction and recovery.

**Heat Safety Coordinator:** Designated person responsible for monitoring weather conditions, implementing heat safety measures, and coordinating emergency medical response.
