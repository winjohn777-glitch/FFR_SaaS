## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Ladder Selection and Pre-Use Inspection
1. **Ladder Selection Criteria**:
   - **Height Requirements**: Select ladder with minimum 3-foot extension above roof line
   - **Duty Rating**: Verify weight capacity for user plus tools and materials
   - **Type Classification**: Use Type I (Industrial) or Type IA (Extra Heavy Duty)
   - **Environmental Conditions**: Consider weather, electrical hazards, and surface conditions
   - **Work Duration**: Plan for extended use comfort and safety features

2. **Pre-Use Inspection Procedures**:
   - **Visual Inspection**: Check for cracks, bends, or structural damage
   - **Hardware Check**: Verify locks, hinges, and extension mechanisms
   - **Rung Condition**: Inspect for wear, damage, or missing components
   - **Label Verification**: Confirm duty rating and inspection date labels
   - **Function Test**: Test extension and locking mechanisms

3. **Documentation and Record Keeping**:
   - Complete pre-use inspection checklist
   - Document any deficiencies or maintenance needs
   - Tag defective ladders for removal from service
   - Update inspection records and maintenance schedules
   - Coordinate with maintenance for repairs when needed

### Phase 2: Ladder Setup and Positioning
1. **Site Preparation and Base Setup**:
   - **Surface Assessment**: Verify firm, level base and adequate support
   - **Clearance Check**: Ensure adequate space for ladder placement and use
   - **Hazard Identification**: Check for electrical lines, traffic, and other hazards
   - **Base Positioning**: Position ladder base at proper distance from wall
   - **Leveling**: Use levelers or blocking to ensure stable, level base

2. **Ladder Angle and Extension Setup**:
   - **4:1 Rule**: Position base 1 foot out for every 4 feet of ladder height
   - **Extension Height**: Extend ladder minimum 3 feet above roof line
   - **Lock Verification**: Ensure extension locks are properly engaged
   - **Stabilization**: Install stabilizers or standoff devices as required
   - **Securing**: Tie off ladder at top to prevent movement

3. **Safety Zone Establishment**:
   - Mark ladder safety zone to prevent interference
   - Post warning signs for vehicle and pedestrian traffic
   - Establish spotters when required for traffic or hazard monitoring
   - Verify emergency access and communication procedures
   - Coordinate with other trades to prevent conflicts

### Phase 3: Safe Ladder Use and Operation
1. **Climbing and Descent Procedures**:
   - **Three-Point Contact**: Maintain two hands and one foot or two feet and one hand
   - **Face the Ladder**: Always face ladder while climbing or descending
   - **Center Body**: Keep belt buckle between side rails
   - **Tool Management**: Use tool belts or hoisting systems for materials
   - **Deliberate Movement**: Take one step at a time with secure footing

2. **Working from Ladder Guidelines**:
   - **Position Limits**: Never lean beyond side rails or overreach
   - **Weight Distribution**: Maintain center of gravity within ladder base
   - **Tool Use**: Use both hands for tools only when properly positioned
   - **Movement Restrictions**: Do not move ladder while occupied
   - **Time Limits**: Take regular breaks to prevent fatigue

3. **Environmental and Hazard Monitoring**:
   - Monitor wind conditions and cease use when unsafe
   - Verify electrical clearance and maintain safe distances
   - Check for changing ground conditions or instability
   - Monitor for traffic and pedestrian hazards
   - Implement weather protection procedures as needed

### Phase 4: Ladder Maintenance and Storage
1. **Post-Use Inspection and Cleaning**:
   - Inspect ladder for damage from use
   - Clean ladder to remove debris and construction materials
