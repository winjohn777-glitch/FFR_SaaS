# SOP-1082: Excavation and Trenching Safety

## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

### Purpose
To establish comprehensive safety procedures for excavation and trenching operations during roofing projects, ensuring compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P and protecting workers from cave-ins, hazardous atmospheres, and other excavation-related hazards in Florida's unique soil and weather conditions.

### Scope
This SOP applies to all Florida First Roofing LLC excavation activities including:
- Foundation repair and waterproofing
- Utility line installation and repair
- Drainage system installation
- Equipment foundation preparation
- Storm damage excavation
- Underground storage tank work
- Septic system access
- Pool deck and patio drainage

## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Excavation**: Any man-made cut, cavity, trench, or depression in an earth surface formed by earth removal.

**Trench**: A narrow excavation made below the surface of the ground, generally deeper than it is wide, with a maximum width of 15 feet.

**Cave-in**: The separation of a mass of soil or rock material from the side of an excavation, or the loss of soil from under a trench shield or support system.

**Competent Person**: An individual capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards and having authorization to take prompt corrective measures.

**Protective System**: A method of protecting employees from cave-ins including sloping, benching, shoring, and shielding systems.

- Document utility locations

### 5.3 Soil Classification
**Type A Soil:**
- Clay, silty clay, sandy clay
- Cemented soil (caliche, hardpan)
- Unconfined compressive strength ≥ 1.5 tons/sq ft

**Type B Soil:**
- Angular gravel, silt, sandy loam
- Previously disturbed soil
- Soil near vibration sources
- Unconfined compressive strength 0.5-1.5 tons/sq ft

**Type C Soil:**
- Granular soils (gravel, sand, loamy sand)
- Submerged soil or soil with seepage
- Vibrating or previously disturbed soil
- Unconfined compressive strength < 0.5 tons/sq ft

### 5.4 Florida-Specific Considerations
- Sandy soil conditions (predominantly Type C)
- High water table locations
- Limestone and coral rock formations
- Hurricane and storm surge effects
- Seasonal rainfall impacts

## 6. EXCAVATION SAFETY PROCEDURES

### 6.1 General Safety Requirements
1. **Depth Restrictions**
   - 5 feet or greater: Protective system required
   - 4 feet or greater: Safe means of egress required
   - 20 feet or greater: Engineer-designed protective system

2. **Access and Egress**
   - Ladder, steps, or ramp within 25 feet of workers
   - Secure and extend 3 feet above excavation
   - Keep access areas clear of excavated material

3. **Spoil Pile Management**
   - Place at least 2 feet from excavation edge
   - Avoid surcharge loading on excavation
   - Keep materials and equipment away from edge

### 6.2 Atmospheric Hazards
**Testing Requirements:**
- Test oxygen levels (19.5% - 23.5%)
- Check for flammable gases
- Monitor for toxic substances
- Test before entry and continuously during work

**Ventilation:**
- Provide adequate ventilation for enclosed areas
- Use mechanical ventilation when needed
- Monitor air quality continuously

### 6.3 Water Control
**Dewatering Systems:**
- Install before worker entry
- Maintain during operations
- Monitor for undermining
- Ensure proper drainage

**Florida Water Considerations:**
- High water table management
- Seasonal flooding protection
- Hurricane surge planning
- Tidal influence in coastal areas

## 7. PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS
