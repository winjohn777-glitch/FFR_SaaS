## BLOCK 3: DEFINITIONS - Key Terms and Concepts

**Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS):** A complete system consisting of anchorage, connectors, and body harness designed to arrest a worker's fall from a working level, including all necessary components working together to protect the user.

**Anchorage Point:** A secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards, or deceleration devices, capable of supporting 5,000 pounds per attached worker or designed by qualified person with safety factor of two.

**Body Harness:** A design of straps that distributes fall arrest forces over thighs, pelvis, waist, chest, and shoulders, with provisions for attaching to other components of personal fall arrest system.

**Competent Person:** An individual capable of identifying existing and predictable fall hazards, authorized to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate hazards, and trained in fall protection equipment selection and use.

**Deceleration Device:** Any mechanism that serves to dissipate energy during a fall, including shock-absorbing lanyards, rip-stitch lanyards, and self-retracting lifelines.

**Free Fall Distance:** The vertical displacement of the fall arrest attachment point during a fall, before the system begins to apply force to arrest the fall, limited to 6 feet maximum.

**Total Fall Distance:** The complete distance a worker falls including free fall distance plus deceleration distance, considering stretch in personal fall arrest system components.
