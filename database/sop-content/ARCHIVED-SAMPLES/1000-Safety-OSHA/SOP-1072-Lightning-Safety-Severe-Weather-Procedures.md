## BLOCK 3: DEFINITIONS - Key Terms and Concepts

**Lightning:** A massive electrostatic discharge between electrically charged regions in clouds or between clouds and the ground, capable of carrying currents of 30,000 amperes or more.

**30-30 Rule:** The safety guideline stating that if thunder is heard within 30 seconds of seeing lightning, people should seek shelter immediately and remain sheltered for 30 minutes after the last thunder is heard.

**Step Potential:** The voltage difference between a person's feet when standing near a lightning ground strike, which can cause serious injury or death.

**Side Flash:** A lateral discharge of electrical current from a lightning-struck object to a nearby person or object, particularly dangerous for personnel near tall structures.

**Safe Shelter:** A substantial building with electrical wiring and plumbing that provides protection from lightning, or a fully enclosed metal vehicle with the windows closed.

**Weather Spotter:** Designated person responsible for monitoring weather conditions and making decisions regarding work suspension and personnel evacuation.
