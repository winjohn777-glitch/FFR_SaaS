# SOP-1081: Confined Space Entry and Safety Procedures

## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

### Purpose
To establish comprehensive procedures for safe entry into confined spaces during roofing operations, ensuring compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146 and protecting workers from atmospheric, physical, and engulfment hazards specific to Florida's climate and roofing environments.

### Scope
This SOP applies to all Florida First Roofing LLC personnel who may encounter or enter confined spaces including:
- Storage tanks and water tanks
- Roof drainage systems and scuppers
- Mechanical equipment enclosures
- Ductwork and ventilation systems
- Underground utility access
- Large equipment housings
- Elevator shaft access areas

## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Confined Space**: A space that is large enough for an employee to enter and perform work, has limited means of entry or exit, and is not designed for continuous occupancy.

**Permit-Required Confined Space**: A confined space that has one or more hazardous characteristics including hazardous atmosphere, engulfment material, configuration hazards, or other serious safety hazards.

**Atmospheric Testing**: Testing for oxygen content, flammable gases, and toxic substances before and during entry.

**Entry Supervisor**: The qualified person responsible for determining if acceptable entry conditions exist and authorizing entry.

**Attendant**: The individual stationed outside the confined space who monitors entrants and maintains communication.

**Entrant**: The qualified person who enters the confined space to perform work.
