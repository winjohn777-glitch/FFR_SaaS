## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Penetration**: Any opening through the roof assembly that requires weatherproofing.

**Flashing**: Impervious material used to prevent water penetration at joints and penetrations.

**Counterflashing**: The upper piece of flashing that overlaps and covers the base flashing.

**Cricket**: A peaked water diverter installed behind chimneys and other penetrations.

**Reglet**: A horizontal groove cut into masonry to receive flashing.
