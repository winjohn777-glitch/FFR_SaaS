## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Installation Preparation and Layout
1. **Substrate and Underlayment Verification**:
   - Inspect roof deck for proper fastening and structural adequacy
   - Verify underlayment installation with proper overlap and attachment
   - Check for proper ventilation and vapor barrier installation
   - Confirm penetration and flashing preparation completion
   - Document any substrate deficiencies requiring correction

2. **Panel Material Staging and Handling**:
   - Position panels at multiple roof locations for efficient installation
   - Verify panel lengths, profiles, and color consistency
   - Check panels for shipping damage or manufacturing defects
   - Organize panels according to installation sequence
   - Establish safe handling procedures to prevent damage

3. **Layout and Reference Line Establishment**:
   - Establish reference lines parallel to eaves and perpendicular to slope
   - Mark panel locations and seam positions
   - Identify ridge, hip, and valley intersection points
   - Plan panel run terminations and expansion joint locations
   - Mark penetration locations for coordination with panel cutting

### Phase 2: Standing Seam Panel Installation
1. **First Panel Installation and Alignment**:
   - Position first panel with proper eave overhang (1" to 1½")
   - Secure panel with clips or fasteners per manufacturer specifications
   - Verify panel alignment and adjust for square and straight installation
   - Check for proper slope and drainage toward gutters
   - Confirm thermal expansion accommodation at panel ends

2. **Progressive Panel Installation**:
   - Install subsequent panels with proper seam engagement
   - Maintain consistent panel spacing and seam alignment
   - Verify clip placement and fastener spacing requirements
   - Check for proper thermal movement accommodation
   - Monitor panel flatness and avoid oil canning

3. **Seam Formation and Sealing**:
   - **Single Lock Seams**: Form mechanical interlock between panels
   - **Double Lock Seams**: Create weather-tight double fold connection
   - **Structural Seams**: Form high-strength connections for structural applications
   - Verify seam continuity and proper formation throughout length
   - Apply sealant where specified by manufacturer

### Phase 3: Exposed Fastener System Installation
1. **Panel Layout and Fastener Pattern Planning**:
   - Mark fastener locations according to approved patterns
   - Plan for proper side lap and end lap requirements
   - Identify structural attachment points and load paths
   - Verify fastener spacing for wind uplift resistance
   - Plan for thermal movement accommodation

2. **Panel Installation and Fastening**:
   - Install panels with proper overlap and alignment
   - Pre-drill holes where required to prevent panel damage
   - Install fasteners with proper torque and sealing washers
   - Verify fastener penetration and substrate engagement
   - Check for proper panel flatness and avoid over-driving fasteners

3. **Weather Sealing and Protection**:
   - Apply appropriate sealants at panel laps and joints
   - Install closure strips and trim pieces
   - Verify gasket placement and compression
   - Check for proper drainage and water shedding
   - Install snow guards and retention systems where required

### Phase 4: Detail Work and System Completion
1. **Ridge and Hip Installation**:
   - Install ridge vents and ventilation systems
   - Position ridge caps with proper overhang and alignment
   - Secure ridge caps with appropriate fastener patterns
   - Apply sealants and weatherproofing materials
   - Verify thermal movement accommodation

2. **Eave and Gutter Integration**:
   - Install eave trim and drip edge components
   - Coordinate with gutter installation and drainage systems
   - Verify proper overhang and water management
   - Install ice dam protection where applicable
   - Check for proper thermal expansion accommodation

3. **Penetration and Equipment Installation**:
   - Cut panels for pipe, vent, and equipment penetrations
   - Install flashing and sealing systems around penetrations
   - Mount equipment with proper structural support
   - Verify weather sealing and thermal compatibility
   - Test all penetrations for water tightness

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- Panel alignment: Maximum ¼" deviation from reference lines over 20-foot span
- Seam integrity: 100% continuous seam formation without gaps or defects
- Fastener compliance: 100% proper installation per manufacturer specifications
- Weather sealing: Zero visible water entry points or seal failures
- Wind resistance: Compliance with approved fastener patterns and spacing

## 9. Troubleshooting Guide
