- [ ] Check weather forecast for installation window (no rain/high winds)
- [ ] Inspect and calibrate nail guns for proper depth and spacing
- [ ] Verify safety equipment installation and crew training compliance
- [ ] Review installation pattern and layout with crew
- [ ] Confirm flashing installation readiness and material availability

## 7. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Phase 1: Installation Preparation and Layout
1. **Deck and Underlayment Verification**:
   - Inspect roof deck for proper fastening and moisture content
   - Verify underlayment installation with proper overlap and fastening
   - Check ice and water shield application at eaves and critical areas
   - Confirm valley and penetration flashing installation readiness
   - Document any deck repairs or preparation deficiencies

2. **Material Staging and Organization**:
   - Position shingle bundles at multiple roof locations for efficiency
   - Verify shingle color consistency and manufacturing date matching
   - Stage flashing materials and accessories at appropriate locations
   - Organize tools and equipment for safe and efficient access
   - Establish material handling procedures to prevent damage

3. **Layout and Chalk Line Establishment**:
   - Establish starter course line parallel to eaves with proper overhang
   - Mark vertical control lines every 6 feet for alignment reference
   - Calculate and mark shingle exposure (typically 5" for architectural)
   - Identify hip and ridge line intersections for proper planning
   - Mark penetration locations for cutting and flashing coordination

### Phase 2: Starter Course and First Course Installation
1. **Starter Strip Installation**:
   - Install starter strips along eaves with 1/4" to 3/8" overhang
   - Use full-width starter strips or cut shingles with tabs removed
   - Nail starter strips 3-4" from eave edge and above cutouts
   - Ensure starter strip extends past rake edges by 1/4" to 3/8"
   - Verify starter strip provides proper sealant coverage for first course

2. **First Course Shingle Installation**:
   - Begin first course with full shingle at rake edge
   - Maintain proper side lap (minimum 2" for architectural shingles)
   - Position shingles with cutouts aligned and proper exposure
   - Install six nails per shingle in designated nail zones
   - Verify nail penetration depth and avoid overdriving

3. **Quality Control for Foundation Courses**:
   - Check straight line alignment and consistent exposure
   - Verify proper overhang at eaves and rake edges
   - Confirm adequate nail penetration and spacing
   - Inspect sealant strip contact and adhesion potential
   - Document any adjustments or corrections made

### Phase 3: Field Shingle Installation
1. **Progressive Course Installation**:
   - Install subsequent courses with proper offset pattern
   - Maintain consistent exposure (typically 5" for architectural)
   - Follow manufacturer's offset requirements (typically 6" minimum)
   - Verify vertical alignment using chalk line references
   - Maintain proper side lap requirements throughout installation

2. **Nail Pattern and Penetration Standards**:
   - **Architectural Shingles**: Six nails per shingle in nail zone
   - **3-Tab Shingles**: Four nails per shingle above cutouts
   - **High Wind Areas**: Additional nails per Florida High Velocity Hurricane Zone requirements
   - Nail penetration minimum 1¼" into deck or through decking
   - Nail heads flush with shingle surface, not overdriven

3. **Wind Resistance Enhancement**:
   - Apply roof cement under shingle tabs in high-wind zones
   - Install additional fasteners per Miami-Dade approval requirements
   - Verify proper sealant strip activation and adhesion
   - Implement enhanced edge fastening protocols
   - Document compliance with hurricane resistance standards

### Phase 4: Ridge, Hip, and Detail Installation
1. **Ridge Cap Installation**:
   - Install ridge vent systems prior to cap shingle installation
   - Cut ridge cap shingles to appropriate length (typically 12")
   - Install ridge caps with 5" exposure and proper overlap
   - Nail each cap shingle with two nails 5½" from butt edge
   - Apply roofing cement under final ridge cap for wind resistance

2. **Hip Installation Procedures**:
   - Install hip starter shingles at bottom of hip runs
   - Cut field shingles to proper angle for hip termination
   - Install hip cap shingles with consistent exposure and alignment
   - Secure hip caps with appropriate nail pattern and cement
   - Verify weather sealing and wind resistance compliance

3. **Penetration and Detail Finishing**:
   - Install step flashing at sidewall intersections
   - Apply sealant around vent penetrations and pipe boots
   - Install ridge vents with proper baffle installation
   - Complete valley finishing with appropriate materials
   - Verify all detail work meets waterproofing standards

## 8. Quality Control Standards
- Shingle alignment: Maximum 1/4" deviation from chalk lines over 10-foot span
- Nail penetration: 100% compliance with minimum penetration requirements
- Exposure consistency: Maximum 1/8" variation in exposure measurements
- Wind resistance: 100% compliance with Miami-Dade hurricane standards
- Weather sealing: Zero visible gaps or potential water entry points

## 9. Troubleshooting Guide
