## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

### Purpose
To establish comprehensive procedures for the installation and integration of roof ventilation systems on all Florida First Roofing LLC projects, ensuring proper attic ventilation, energy efficiency, moisture control, and compliance with Florida Building Code requirements while addressing Florida's unique climate challenges including high humidity, extreme heat, and severe weather conditions.

### Scope
This SOP applies to all ventilation system installation activities including:
- Ridge vent installation and integration
- Soffit and eave ventilation systems
- Gable and wall-mounted vents
- Power ventilation systems
- Solar-powered ventilation units
- Whole house fans and attic ventilation
- Ventilation system balancing and optimization

## 2. DEFINITIONS

**Attic Ventilation**: The process of providing air circulation in attic spaces to control temperature and moisture.

**Net Free Area (NFA)**: The actual unobstructed area through which air can flow, measured in square inches.

**Intake Ventilation**: Ventilation openings that allow outside air to enter the attic space, typically located at the eaves.

**Exhaust Ventilation**: Ventilation openings that allow air to exit the attic space, typically located at or near the ridge.

**Balanced Ventilation**: A ventilation system with equal amounts of intake and exhaust ventilation area.

**Stack Effect**: The natural air movement caused by temperature differences between inside and outside air.

**Vapor Barrier**: A material that reduces the rate of water vapor transmission through a building assembly.
